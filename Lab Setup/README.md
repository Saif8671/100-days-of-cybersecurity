# Lab Setup for Cybersecurity

This repository provides step-by-step instructions to set up a cybersecurity lab for learning, experimentation, and research. The lab setup includes guidance for installing VirtualBox, downloading virtual machine (VM) files for Kali Linux, and creating your own Xubuntu or Ubuntu MATE VMs. 

## Prerequisites

1. A computer with at least:
   - **Processor**: 64-bit capable CPU
   - **RAM**: 8 GB (minimum)
   - **Storage**: 50 GB free space
   - **Virtualization**: Enabled in BIOS/UEFI

2. A stable internet connection.

## Steps to Set Up Your Lab

### 1. Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox is an open-source virtualization tool that allows you to run multiple operating systems on your computer.

- **Download VirtualBox:**  
  [Download VirtualBox (Windows Version)](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/7.0.18/VirtualBox-7.0.18-162988-Win.exe)

- **Installation Instructions:**
  1. Run the installer.
  2. Follow the installation wizard prompts.
  3. Ensure you select the option to install the VirtualBox Network Adapter.

### 2. Download Kali Linux VM
>[!NOTE]
> Kali Linux is a popular Linux distribution used by cybersecurity professionals. However, it is not recommended for beginners. For working professionals, you can download the prebuilt VM:

- **Download:**  
  [Kali Linux for VirtualBox](https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2024.4/kali-linux-2024.4-virtualbox-amd64.7z)

- **Steps to Set Up Kali Linux VM:**
  1. Download and extract the VM file using software like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).
  2. Open VirtualBox and import the VM file:
     - Go to **File > Import Appliance**.
     - Select the `.ova` file and follow the prompts.
  3. Start the VM to launch Kali Linux.

>[!WARNING]
> Kali Linux is designed for advanced users and professionals. Beginners are encouraged to use Xubuntu or Ubuntu MATE instead.

### 3. Create Your Own VM

You can create your own virtual machine using Xubuntu or Ubuntu MATE. These are lightweight Linux distributions suitable for beginners in cybersecurity.

#### Option 1: Xubuntu

- **Download Xubuntu ISO:**  
  [Xubuntu Official Website](https://xubuntu.org/)

- **Steps to Create a Xubuntu VM:**
  1. Open VirtualBox and click **New** to create a new VM.
  2. Name your VM and select **Linux** as the type and **Ubuntu (64-bit)** as the version.
  3. Allocate at least **2 GB RAM** and **20 GB storage**.
  4. Attach the downloaded ISO:
     - Go to **Settings > Storage**.
     - Add the ISO under **Controller: IDE**.
  5. Start the VM and follow the on-screen installation prompts.

#### Option 2: Ubuntu MATE

- **Download Ubuntu MATE ISO:**  
  [Ubuntu MATE Official Website](https://ubuntu-mate.org/)

- **Steps to Create an Ubuntu MATE VM:**
  1. Follow the same steps as for Xubuntu, replacing the ISO file with the Ubuntu MATE ISO.

### 4. General Tips for Beginners

- Begin with **Xubuntu** or **Ubuntu MATE** to familiarize yourself with Linux commands and the environment.
- **Avoid starting directly with Kali Linux, as it is tailored for advanced tasks and may be overwhelming for beginners**.

### 5. Networking Configuration (CRITICAL)
Network Mode: Host-Only Adapter
Why?
Isolated lab
No internet exposure
Safe attack simulation
Example Topology:
[ Kali Linux ] ↔ [ Metasploitable ] ↔ [ Windows 10 ]

6. Blue Team / SOC Tools (Optional but Powerful)
Install on Windows VM
Tool	Purpose
Splunk Free	SIEM, log analysis
Sysmon	Advanced Windows logging
Elastic Stack	Threat detection
OSSEC	Host-based IDS

7. Practice Platforms (Cloud-Based – No Risk)
Use alongside your lab:
Platform	Focus
TryHackMe	Beginner → SOC → Pentest
Hack The Box	Intermediate / Advanced
CyberDefenders	Blue-team labs
OverTheWire	Linux fundamentals
